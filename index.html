                As an owner, you have to handle every aspect of your business, from cooking to managing, from accounting
                to marketing.

                Chances are – you feel like you’re not equipped to deal with everything that’s coming your way.

                Every problem seems important. Every problem seems urgent.

                But you have no idea how to solve them.

                It doesn’t have to be that way.

                <h2>Spice pasta</h2>
                <p>Did you grow up eating pasta out of a can? I sure did and I LOVED it. Our pantry would always have an
                    abundance of 2-for-1 on sale cans of the saucy stuff and I would heat one up whenever I felt like a
                    snack. I miss my kid metabolism…I can’t believe I used to eat cans of pasta as a snack! If only my
                    snacks now were the snacks of my youth…I would be so happy.</p>

                <h2>Maxican Pasta</h2>
                <p>Is this recipe super quick to make? Yes and no. It only needs 5 minutes on high pressure in your
                    Instant Pot, but of course it takes time for your IP to come up to pressure. Also, you need to mix
                    and roll out meatballs. But, you don’t have to cook and drain your pasta and you don’t have to worry
                    about hanging out near the stove in case your tomato sauce starts splattering</p>

                <h2>Red sauce pasta</h2>
                <p>Red sauce pasta in pasta often have a bad reputation. Red sauce pasta are one of those vegetables
                    that is easy to throw into anything so it kind of gets defaulted to being a not special vegetable.
                    But Red sauce pasta are a sign of spring. They taste bright and fresh and green. Red sauce pasta are
                    perfect!</p>
